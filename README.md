This project is aimed toward practicing my basic HTML knowledge that I have acquired while doing the Odin project.

I will be building a basic recipe website. This website will have an index page and other links containing recipes to the different dishes provided on the site. Some inspiration for tasty treats!

After completing this project, I have accomplished:

Properly setting up html files 
Linking html files together
Inputting images with alternative text
Creating ordered and unordered lists for the steps and recipes
Adding brief summaries of the dishes by emphasizing them below their pictures
Implementing a body and paragraph element to describe what the recipe is all about
Linking a CSS stylesheet to the HTML files
Implementing various types of CSS selectors and inheritance, keeping in mind of specificity rules.
